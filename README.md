# Network-Integration-Using-Linux-Servers

we need to configure a minimum of 4 different servers using either Ubuntu 14.04.04 LTS or 16.04.4 LTS versions to verify this functionality.

I have implemented concepts like FTP, VPN, DNS, DHCP etc and successfully established a complete end to end private network using 6 machines. (5 ubuntu Servers and 1 Windows Client machien)
